# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This Prework Study Guide was created for the purpose of being able to learn and practice using HTML,CSS,Git, and JavaScript. Along with being able to reference this information later on in the course. I learned a lot during this prework so being able to keep that information in here is a great benefit to me.
